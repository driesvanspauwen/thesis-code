# Evaluation "Bending muwms" paper (Flexo framework)
## Gates
### Accuracies
The Flexo compiler can be configured by setting environment variables. The script `optimizer.py` can be used for finding the best parameters to build gates (`circuits/gates/gates.elf`). The script tests different combinations of `RET_WM_DIV_ROUNDS`, `WM_DELAY`, `WR_OFFSET`, prints the results of all combinations in `grid_search_results` and outputs the best performing combination as well for every gate:

## Arithmetic circuits
- use fixed parameters: RET_WM_DIV_ROUNDS=25 WR_OFFSET=960
- these are shown to be reliable by the grid search of the gates
